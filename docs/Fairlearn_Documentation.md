## Fairness Metrics Explained

### **Demographic Parity**
**Definition**: The proportion of positive predictions should be similar across all groups.

**Metrics**:
- **Demographic Parity Difference**: `|P(YÌ‚=1|A=0) - P(YÌ‚=1|A=1)|`
- **Demographic Parity Ratio**: `min(P(YÌ‚=1|A=0), P(YÌ‚=1|A=1)) / max(P(YÌ‚=1|A=0), P(YÌ‚=1|A=1))`

**Interpretation**:
- **Difference < 0.1**: Good demographic parity
- **Difference 0.1-0.2**: Moderate issues
- **Difference > 0.2**: Significant bias

### **Equalized Odds**
**Definition**: True positive and false positive rates should be similar across groups.

**Metrics**:
- **Equalized Odds Difference**: Maximum difference in TPR/FPR across groups
- **Equalized Odds Ratio**: Ratio of minimum to maximum TPR/FPR

**Interpretation**:
- **Difference < 0.1**: Good equalized odds
- **Difference 0.1-0.2**: Moderate issues
- **Difference > 0.2**: Significant bias

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Fairlearn Evaluation**
```python
from fairlearn_evaluation import FairlearnEvaluator

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = FairlearnEvaluator()

# Prepare binary classification data
y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features, group_data = evaluator.prepare_binary_classification_data(
    model, scaler, group_column='Economic_Group'
)

# Compute fairness metrics
fairness_metrics = evaluator.compute_fairness_metrics(
    y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features, 'Economic_Group'
)

# Print results
print(f"Demographic Parity Difference: {fairness_metrics['demographic_parity_difference']:.4f}")
print(f"Equalized Odds Difference: {fairness_metrics['equalized_odds_difference']:.4f}")
```

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**
```python
# Evaluate across all groups
all_results = evaluator.comprehensive_fairlearn_evaluation(model, scaler)

# Save detailed report
evaluator.save_fairlearn_report(all_results)

# Print interpretation
evaluator.print_fairness_interpretation(all_results)
```

## Group Analysis Results

### **Economic Groups (Group A vs Group B)**

#### **Group A (High Rates)**
- **Characteristics**: Restrictive monetary policy periods
- **Federal Funds Rate**: High (above median)
- **Delinquency Rate**: Lower average (2.27%)
- **Economic Impact**: Tighter credit conditions

#### **Group B (Low Rates)**
- **Characteristics**: Accommodative monetary policy periods
- **Federal Funds Rate**: Low (below median)
- **Delinquency Rate**: Higher average (5.25%)
- **Economic Impact**: Easier credit conditions

### **Sample Fairness Results**
```
ðŸ“Š Demographic Parity Metrics:
  Difference: 0.8950
  Ratio: 0.1050

ðŸ“Š Equalized Odds Metrics:
  Difference: 1.0000
  Ratio: 0.0000

ðŸ“Š Group Performance Metrics:
  Group A (High Rates):
    Selection Rate: 0.0500
    True Positive Rate: 0.0000
    False Positive Rate: 0.0500
    Accuracy: 0.9500

  Group B (Low Rates):
    Selection Rate: 0.9450
    True Positive Rate: 1.0000
    False Positive Rate: 0.9450
    Accuracy: 0.0550
```

## Fairness Interpretation

### **Demographic Parity Analysis**
- **High Difference (0.8950)**: Significant bias in selection rates
- **Low Ratio (0.1050)**: Very different selection rates between groups
- **Interpretation**: Model strongly favors one group over another

### **Equalized Odds Analysis**
- **High Difference (1.0000)**: Perfect separation but unfair
- **Low Ratio (0.0000)**: No overlap in prediction accuracy
- **Interpretation**: Model has perfect accuracy for one group but fails for the other

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Different Economic Conditions**: High vs low interest rate environments
2. **Different Delinquency Patterns**: Groups have inherently different risk profiles
3. **Model Bias**: LSTM may be learning group-specific patterns rather than generalizable features

## Fairness Mitigation Strategies

### **1. Fairness-Aware Training**
```python
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity

# Train with demographic parity constraint
constraint = DemographicParity()
estimator = ExponentiatedGradient(
    base_estimator=model,
    constraints=constraint
)
```

### **2. Post-Processing**
```python
from fairlearn.postprocessing import ThresholdOptimizer

# Apply threshold optimization
postprocessor = ThresholdOptimizer(
    estimator=model,
    constraints="demographic_parity"
)
```

### **3. Data Balancing**
- **Collect More Data**: Ensure balanced representation across groups
- **Augmentation**: Generate synthetic data for underrepresented groups
- **Sampling**: Use stratified sampling during training

### **4. Feature Engineering**
- **Remove Sensitive Features**: Don't use group information directly
- **Add Fair Features**: Include features that correlate with fairness
- **Feature Selection**: Choose features that don't introduce bias

## Implementation Details

### **Binary Classification Conversion**
```python
# Convert regression to binary classification
threshold = np.median(targets_original)
y_true_binary = (targets_original > threshold).astype(int)
y_pred_binary = (predictions_original > threshold).astype(int)
```

### **Group-Specific Thresholds**
```python
# Use different thresholds for different groups
for group in groups:
    group_threshold = np.median(group_data['target'])
    y_pred_binary = (predictions_original > group_threshold).astype(int)
```

### **Metric Computation**
```python
# Compute fairness metrics
dp_diff = demographic_parity_difference(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features)
eo_diff = equalized_odds_difference(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features)
```
